# COVID-19-Global-Data-Tracker

A data analysis project tracking COVID-19 cases, deaths, and vaccination trends globally using real-world datasets.

## ðŸŽ¯ Objectives

- Import and clean global COVID-19 data
- Analyze trends over time: cases, deaths, vaccinations
- Compare metrics across countries (Kenya, Rwanda, USA)
- Visualize insights using line plots, choropleth maps, and summary statistics
- Document key findings in a presentable format

## ðŸ›  Tools & Libraries

- Python
- pandas
- matplotlib
- seaborn
- plotly
- Jupyter Notebook

## ðŸš€ How to Run the Project

1. Clone the repository or download the files.

## ðŸ“ˆ Insights & Reflections

- The U.S. showed the fastest and widest vaccine rollout among the selected countries.
- Rwanda maintained low case numbers with consistent control.
- Death rates varied significantly â€” deeper analysis into testing/reporting policies recommended.
- Some anomalies in data hint at gaps in daily reporting from specific regions.
